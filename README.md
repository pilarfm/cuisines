# Cuisines

This is I project I built to put in practice all my Data Science knowledge.
The problem that is solved is: "Determine the origin of the cuisin of a certain dish according to its ingredients"
In order to solve it I used Jupyter Notebooks with Phyton, and I followed every step from the Foundational Methodology by John Rollings:
